### Draw a triangular stand

--- task ---

Set the fill colour to `siena` (brown). 

Draw a triangle using the x and y coordinates for each of the corners.

![A brown triangle on grass and against a sky with the coordinate points labelled at 150, 350 and 200, 150 and 250, 350). The corners of the canvas are also labelled as x=0, y=0 in the top left and x=400, y=400 i the bottom right.](images/stand_coords.png){:width="400px"}

### Draw the target circles

--- task ---

The largest part of the target is a blue **circle**.

Set the fill colour to `blue`. 

Draw a circle with x and y coordinates for its centre and a width. 

![A brown triangle and blue circle on grass and against a sky. The circle is labelled with the coordinates x=200, y=200 as the centre and circle width of 170.](images/circle-coords.png){:width="400px"}

    fill('blue')
    circle(200, 200, 170) # Outer circle

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code to see the first large blue circle. 

The blue circle was drawn after the stand so it is in front:

The target is made of different-sized circles with the same centre coordinates (200, 200). 

--- task ---

**Add** coloured circles for the inner and middle parts of the target.

    fill('sienna') 
    triangle(150, 350, 200, 150, 250, 350) # Stand 
    fill('blue')
    circle(200, 200, 170) # Outer circle 
    fill('red') # Set the circle fill colour to inner 
    circle(200, 200, 110) # Inner circle - x, y, width of the circle 
    fill('yellow') # Set the circle fill colour to middle      
    circle(200, 200, 30)  # Middle circle - x, y, width of the circle

**Test:** üîÑ Run your project to see the target with three coloured circles. 

![A brown triangle with three coloured circles on grass and against a sky.](images/three-circles.png){:width="400px"}

**Debug:** üêû Check that you have used the American spelling of 'color' (without a 'u').
