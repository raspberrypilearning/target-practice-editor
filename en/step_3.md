### Draw a triangular stand

--- task ---

Set the fill colour to `wood` (brown). 

Draw a triangle using the x and y coordinates for each of the corners.

![A brown triangle on grass and against a sky with the coordinate points labelled at 150, 350 and 200, 150 and 250, 350). The corners of the canvas are also labelled as x=0, y=0 in the top left and x=400, y=400 i the bottom right.](images/stand_coords.png){:width="400px"}

### Draw the target circles

--- task ---

The largest part of the target is a blue **circle**.

Set the fill colour to `outer` (blue). 

Draw a circle with x and y coordinates for its centre and a width. 

![A brown triangle and blue circle on grass and against a sky. The circle is labelled with the coordinates x=200, y=200 as the centre and circle width of 170.](images/circle-coords.png){:width="400px"}

**Test:** Run your code to see the first large blue circle. 

The blue circle was drawn after the stand so it is in front:

üëÄ Find your colour variables in the `draw` function. 

Create two variables called `inner` and `middle` to store colours for the other circles. 

The `color` function expects three numbers: one each for red, green, and blue.

language: python
filename: main.py - draw()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 17
line_highlights: 24, 25

def draw():   
  # Things to do in every frame
  global wood
  sky = color(92, 204, 206)   
  grass = color(149, 212, 122)   
  wood = color(145, 96, 51)   
  outer = color(0, 120, 180) # Blue    
  inner = color(210, 60, 60) # Red    
  middle = color(220, 200, 0) # Yellow

The target is made of different-sized circles with the same centre coordinates (200, 200). 

--- task ---

**Add** coloured circles for the inner and middle parts of the target.

language: python
filename: main.py - draw()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 31
line_highlights: 35, 36, 37, 38

  fill(wood)    
  triangle(150, 350, 200, 150, 250, 350)  
  fill(outer)   
  circle(200, 200, 170)
  fill(inner) # Set the circle fill colour to inner      
  circle(200, 200, 110) # Inner circle - x, y, width of the circle  
  fill(middle) # Set the circle fill colour to middle      
  circle(200, 200, 30) # Middle circle - x, y, width of the circle

**Test:** üîÑ Run your project to see the target with three coloured circles. 

![A brown triangle with three coloured circles on grass and against a sky.](images/three-circles.png){:width="400px"}

**Debug:** üêû Check that you have used the American spelling of 'color' (without a 'u').
